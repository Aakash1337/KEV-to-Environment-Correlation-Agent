# KEV-to-Environment-Correlation-Agent
CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog is a curated list of vulnerabilities with evidence of active exploitation and is intended to drive prioritization. The operational challenge is that “KEV relevance” is only actionable after correlating each KEV entry to the assets, software versions, and exposure context in your environment.
